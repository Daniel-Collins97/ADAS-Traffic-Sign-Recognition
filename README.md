# Traffic Sign Recognition System

## MATLab Files

The `Traffic Sign Recognition` folder in this repo holds the MATLab files. There is one `.m` file that should be run in MATLab. The remaining files are images that show the progression of the code. The images should be inserted to the code as follows;

1.  `Shapes2.png` - This image contains basic shapes to ensure the programme is able to correctly identify these shapes.
 
 2. `signs2.jpg` - This image contains a variety of traffic signs on a plain white background. This image is used to ensure the programme is able to pick up traffic signs.

2. `sampleSign.png` - This image contains a real-life version of a traffic sign. This is used to show how the programme works with real-life traffic signs.
